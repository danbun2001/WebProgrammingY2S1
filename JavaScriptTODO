THE GAME BOARD
The game is not going to be the size of the full screen but rather in a window that will appear on the page
The game will move with each individual player meaning that they will not be able to see the full screen or all the other players at once
The games will be played in an allocated time slot (e.g. 2 or 3 minutes)

GAME PIECES

TRAINS
-	The train will be controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard
-	The train will always be moving in the direction it is facing and the user will just be controlling the direction 
  - This will prevent users hiding in the corner of a game
-	Players will be randomly assigned a colour of train as they enter the game

PASSENGERS AND CARRIAGES
-	The user will collect passengers/carriages by moving over the icon which will increment their score
-	Passenger icons will move 
  -	Need to look into this to determine the difficulty
-	Once a user has collected a passenger, the icon will disappear from the screen
-	New passengers will spawn after a certain period of time 
  - E.g. 10 or 15 seconds
-	After a user has collected a certain number of passengers, they will be awarded with a carriage 

OBSTACLES
-	When the player collides with an opponent’s train, the player is destroyed 
-	When the player collides with an obstacle (e.g. buildings) the player is destroyed 
-	When a player collides with their own carriages, they are destroyed
-	When a player has been destroyed, all of their carriages and passengers become available for other players to collect for themselves
  -	e.g. if a player has a score of 22, they may drop 4 carriages and 2 people
-	When the player has been destroyed, they are shown a ‘death’ screen for a certain amount of time (e.g. 5 seconds) and then spawned back into the game to try and collect passengers again

SCORE
-	The players score will be incremented each time they pick a player up
-	When a player has collected a certain number of passengers (e.g. 10) the train will gain a carriage 
-	When a player is destroyed, their score is reset to 0
-	The player with the highest number of passengers at the current time will be at the top of the leaderboard 
-	The player with the highest number of passengers at the end of the game will be the winner 
-	The game will have a feature that keeps track of which player gained the longest train throughout the entire game (whether they were destroyed or not) and that user will get a special mention at the end

GAME OVER
-	The game will have a time limit and will end when the timer is finished 
-	The winner will be displayed at the end of the game along with the ‘special mention’ of the player who had the longest train
-	Will have an option to return to the main menu

NOTES
-	Good game tutorial on W3Schools which shows many concepts which may be helpful
